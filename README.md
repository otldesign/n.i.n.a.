N.I.N.A., for Nearby Image Notification Application, continuously notifiers users through text and voice of nearby images and objects. When the app is running, N.I.N.A. uses the onboard camera to continously analyze images and inform the user their common classifications. A user can switch between voice and textual notifications by simply tapping on the displayed video screen.
